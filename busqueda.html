            Nombre = HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites <br>
            Autor = Jon Duckett <br>
            <p>Resumen = A full-color introduction to the basics of HTML and CSS!
            Every day, more and more people want to learn some HTML and CSS. Joining the professional web designers and programmers are new audiences who need to know a little bit of code at work (update a content management system or e-commerce store) and those who want to make their personal blogs more attractive. Many books teaching HTML and CSS are dry and only written for those who want to become programmers, which is why this book takes an entirely new approach.

            Introduces HTML and CSS in a way that makes them accessible to everyone--hobbyists, students, and professionals--and it's full-color throughout
            Utilizes information graphics and lifestyle photography to explain the topics in a simple way that is engaging
            Boasts a unique structure that allows you to progress through the chapters from beginning to end or just dip into topics of particular interest at your leisure
            This educational book is one that you will enjoy picking up, reading, then referring back to. It will make you wish other technical topics were presented in such a simple, attractive and engaging way!

            Nombre = Javascript: The Definitive Guide: Master the World's Most-Used Programming Language <br>
            Autor = David   Flanagan <br>
            <p>
                Resumen = JavaScript is the programming language of the web and is used by more software developers today than any other programming language. For nearly 25 years this best seller has been the go-to guide for JavaScript programmers. The seventh edition is fully updated to cover the 2020 version of JavaScript, and new chapters cover classes, modules, iterators, generators, Promises, async/await, and metaprogramming. You'll find illuminating and engaging example code throughout.

                This book is for programmers who want to learn JavaScript and for web developers who want to take their understanding and mastery to the next level. It begins by explaining the JavaScript language itself, in detail, from the bottom up. It then builds on that foundation to cover the web platform and Node.js.

                Topics include:

                Types, values, variables, expressions, operators, statements, objects, and arrays
                Functions, classes, modules, iterators, generators, Promises, and async/await
                JavaScript's standard library: data structures, regular expressions, JSON, i18n, etc.
                The web platform: documents, components, graphics, networking, storage, and threads
                Node.js: buffers, files, streams, threads, child processes, web clients, and web servers
                Tools and language extensions that professional JavaScript developers rely on
